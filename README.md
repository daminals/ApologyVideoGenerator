# ApologyVideoGenerator

A problem our generation faces is the need to apologize for the horrible things we have done.
Youtube sensations do so many horrible things, and apologize in such a generic and uniform way, the apology video has become its own 'unqiue' genre (I say 'unque' because these videos are all practically the same)

In order to maximize efficiency, a combination of sad videos with a text to speech function could easily generate these videos, saving precious time.

To that end, this program aims to automate the creation of Apology vidoes, and it achieves its purpose!

# Java GUI
After continuous work, a frontend GUI for users is finally operational. This allows users to not only generate their video outside of the command line, but also VIEW the video within the GUI!

# Next Steps


Despite the actual program being finished, there is more I'd like to do with it. Namely, upload it onto a simple website to allow anybody to generate their own apology videos

Improve discord bot functionality-- Current method of operation engages in blocking, which is not ideal for a discord bot.

In addition, there are more bugs than I would like in the program, and they cause it to crash every so often. These bugs are typically within writing videos to file, and mixing the audio
